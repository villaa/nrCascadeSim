# Pull Requests

When submitting pull requests, 
please default to submitting to the `develop` branch and never submit directly to the `master` branch. 
This allows us to correctly manage versioning. 
If you submit a pull request directly to the `master` branch, you will be asked to change the target to `develop`.
